## Randolio: Community Service

Requirements:
QBCore or ESX Framework |  ox_lib: https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/tag/v3.16.2

# Installation/Usage

First, be sure to run the SQL into your database.

```
/cs id tasks - Used to send a player to community service using the player's server id and the amount of tasks.

/removecs id - Will remove the player from community service (if they are in it)

For QB, it uses job types to check for police jobs. For ESX, if you check the bridge, you'll see there's a table with police = true as the only entry right now. Add all your other police jobs into that table following the format. (if you have more police jobs)
```

This is my first time using a bridge to support both QB and ESX frameworks. I tested on both and it seemed to work fine, report any issues on github.
